Welcome to my Skill Development Lab repository! This project contains a set of 16 practical web development experiments that span across multiple technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, and Django. Each task builds upon real-world use cases like shopping carts, weather apps, student management systems, and more.

## üîµ HTML / JavaScript / CSS

### 1. Responsive Shopping Cart Web Application  
Built a fully functional shopping cart web application with essential pages like registration, login, catalog, and cart.

*Key Highlights:*
- Used semantic HTML5 tags for better structure and accessibility.
- Applied CSS Flexbox and Grid for clean, modern layouts.
- Implemented form handling for login and sign-up pages.
- Designed a product catalog with dynamic price updates.
- Ensured responsiveness across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

---

### 2. Bootstrap Integration  
Enhanced the previous shopping cart app using Bootstrap framework to ensure mobile-first responsiveness.

*Key Highlights:*
- Applied Bootstrap grid system to re-structure layouts.
- Used Bootstrap forms, buttons, and navbar for UI consistency.
- Integrated modals for login and cart preview.
- Added responsive alerts and validation messages.
- Customized Bootstrap themes with CSS overrides.

---

### 3. JavaScript Client-side Validation  
Implemented JavaScript-based validations for forms on registration, login, and cart pages.

*Key Highlights:*
- Added validation for email, password strength, and required fields.
- Displayed real-time error feedback without page reload.
- Used regular expressions to match valid input patterns.
- Prevented form submission until all inputs are valid.
- Improved user experience by reducing form submission errors.

### 4. Weather App using ES6 & Async JS  
Explored ES6 features like arrow functions, promises, callbacks, and async/await.

*Key Highlights:*
- Used fetch() with async/await to call the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Created arrow functions and clean modular JS code.
- Handled API errors gracefully using try...catch.
- Parsed and formatted JSON data for clarity.
- Integrated Chart.js to plot temperature trends visually.

---

### 5. Java Standalone CRUD Application  
Developed a standalone Java application connected to MySQL database with full CRUD operations.

*Key Highlights:*
- Used JDBC to connect Java with MySQL.
- Created a Student class for object mapping.
- Handled exceptions and edge cases effectively.
- Built a CLI interface for user-friendly operations.
- Performed Insert, Read, Update, and Delete seamlessly.

---

### 6. Java Servlet Controller  
Connected the frontend shopping cart app with MySQL using Java servlets as a controller layer.

*Key Highlights:*
- Implemented MVC architecture with servlets.
- Used HTTP GET and POST methods for dynamic requests.
- Managed form data and interacted with the database in real-time.
- Forwarded results to JSP pages using RequestDispatcher.
- Ensured session tracking and login authentication through servlet.

## üü° Node.js

### 8. Custom HTTP Server in Node.js  
Created a basic custom web server using Node.js's native http module. Also explored other core modules like os, path, and events.

### 9. Express.js REST API Integration  
Built an Express.js web application that interacts with a RESTful API to perform CRUD operations on student records. Used Postman for testing endpoints.

### 10. JWT Authentication  
Secured the Express application by adding JWT-based authentication to create protected routes and authorized access control.

---

## üü¢ React.js

### 11. React Student Management System  
Developed a student management system using React with pages like registration, login, contact, and about. Used react-router for smooth page navigation.

### 12. Weather App in React with Chart.js  
Created a weather application in React that fetches current and historical data from OpenWeatherMap API and visualizes it using Chart.js.

### 13. React TODO Application  
Built a simple and elegant TODO list application using React components. Deployed the project on GitHub for public access and version control.

---

## üî¥ Django

### 14. Django Student Management System  
Developed a Django-based student management system with similar functionality as the React version. Utilized Django‚Äôs powerful routing and templating system.

### 15. Django Weather App with Chart.js  
Built a Django app that retrieves weather data from OpenWeatherMap and displays both current and historical data using Chart.js in the frontend.

### 16. Django TODO App  
Created a TODO application using Django‚Äôs built-in functionalities. Implemented full CRUD support and deployed it on GitHub for collaboration and sharing.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Each of these experiments helped me build a strong foundation in full-stack web development. I explored both frontend and backend technologies, integrated third-party APIs, and implemented secure, responsive, and user-friendly applications.

Feel free to explore the individual folders for source code and instructions.
